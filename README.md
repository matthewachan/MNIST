# Description
This program loads images of a handwritten characters and uses those images to train a classification model. The model can then use that data to identify new characters passed into the model. It uses the supervised learning method to train the model (using the Linear Support Vector Classification method) on a certain percentage of the handwritten images. The remainder of the handwritten images are used to test the accuracy of our model. In this program, the model is only trained to classify the English characters 'a', 'b', 'c'.
